AI Virtual Assistant is a Python-based mini project that performs daily tasks using voice commands. It uses speech_recognition to capture user input and pyttsx3 to respond through voice. Key features include playing songs on YouTube (pywhatkit), telling the current time and date (datetime), fetching Wikipedia summaries, opening popular websites via webbrowser, telling jokes (pyjokes), and setting alarms. It also includes a reminder system and two fun games: Rock-Paper-Scissors and Number Guessing. The assistant runs in a continuous loop, listening for commands and responding with appropriate actions. It includes error handling for unrecognized input or connection issues. Libraries used: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, pyjokes, webbrowser, random, and time. This project is an interactive way to understand voice automation, basic AI logic, and Python library integration in real-world applications.
